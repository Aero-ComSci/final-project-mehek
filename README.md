Who is the program for?
The program is for anyone who wants to play a game, or wants to take a quick break during summer. There isnâ€™t always a lot to do during the summer, with school out, thats why this is a game you can play in your free time!
What the program does, what does it automate?
The main point of my code is to play a quick game in your freetime, especially becuase during summer it can be really hot outside and there isn't always much to do in your house!
